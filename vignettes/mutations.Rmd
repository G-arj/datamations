```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r load, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(datamations)
```


### New data with added variable

```{r newdata}

small_salary <- dplyr::mutate(
  small_salary, 
  SalaryTwo = runif(nrow(small_salary), min = 60, max = 110),
  logNorm = rlnorm(nrow(small_salary), meanlog = 0, sdlog = 1)
  )

```

### Log normal mutation

```{r lognorm}

"small_salary %>%
  mutate(logged = log10(logNorm)) %>%
  group_by(Degree) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(logged))" %>%
  datamation_sanddance()
```


### Mathematical Notation

```{r mutations}

"small_salary %>%
  mutate(newVar = Salary^2) %>%
  group_by(Degree) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(newVar))" %>%
  datamation_sanddance()

"small_salary %>%
  mutate(newVar = 1 / Salary) %>%
  group_by(Degree) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(newVar))" %>%
  datamation_sanddance()

```

### Multivariate

```{r mutivar}

"small_salary %>%
  mutate(newVar = Salary + SalaryTwo) %>%
  group_by(Degree) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(newVar))" %>%
  datamation_sanddance()

"small_salary %>%
  mutate(newVar = Salary / SalaryTwo) %>%
  group_by(Degree) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(newVar))" %>%
  datamation_sanddance()

```

### Mutations in a summarize

Currently the following statements error:

a. summarize(z = sum(x + y))
b. summarize(z = sum(x / y))
c. summarize(z = sum(x) / sum(y))


### Two variable mutates

Two variable mutates also currently error

```{r twovar, error = TRUE}
"small_salary %>%
  mutate(newVar = Salary + SalaryTwo, newVarTwo = Salary^2) %>%
  group_by(Degree) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(newVar))" %>%
  datamation_sanddance()
```
